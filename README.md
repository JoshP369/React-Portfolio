# React Portfolio
## Project Overview
The React Portfolio project marks the culmination of my efforts to showcase my skills and projects through a modern and dynamic portfolio site built with React. This portfolio not only reflects my technical proficiency but also demonstrates my ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to present a polished and professional web presence.

## User Story
As a developer eager to highlight my achievements and capabilities, I embarked on the React Portfolio challenge. My goal was to create an interactive and visually appealing portfolio that not only houses my projects but also offers an engaging and seamless experience for anyone exploring my work.

## Acceptance Criteria
The successful completion of the React Portfolio project is defined by meeting the following criteria:

- It is done when the portfolio is built with React.

- It is done when the Home Page is a welcoming landing page that contains my name, headshot or avatar, brand statement, and an indication that it's my portfolio site.

- It is done when the portfolio follows a mobile-first design approach.

- It is done when the portfolio includes essential information such as my name, links to my GitHub profile, LinkedIn page, email address, optional phone number, and a CV in PDF format containing up-to-date projects and professional experience.

- It is done when the Projects section includes project title, link to the deployed version, link to the GitHub repository, and a GIF or screenshot of the deployed application.
